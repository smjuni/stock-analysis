# **Stock-Analysis**

## **Overview of Project**

The purpose of this analysis is to provide Steve with a macro enabled workbook that is able to run through many stocks without over utilizing computer memory and providing results in a faster time frame. We will do this by refactoring the existing workbook.





## **Results**
    "Using images and examples of your code, compare he stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script." 




This is the time taken to run for year 2017 after refactoring the original vba script:

## **Summary**

 1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

   ### *Advantages* ###
   The main advantage to refactoring code is that it will take fewer of the computers resources to run it. It will also generate the output faster and is able to be adapted to take on larger amounts of data without compromising the effiency or effectiveness of the code.

   ### *Disadvantages* ###
   The main disadvantage is that it is time consuming to edit the code that has already been written. Another disadvantage is that it is possible to break the code by refactoring it.
